    <string name="nurofen">Prescription nurofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed
        for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid).

        or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever,
        but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset.
        If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package
        or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed.
        Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.

        and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions.
        If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen.</string>
